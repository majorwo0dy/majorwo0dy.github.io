    <a href="http://danielfiller.com/">http://danielfiller.com/</a><br>

<p>The Header that caught my eye was at danielfiller.com. It looks great and so simple to use.
    The designer built this website to show his skills in web development. I would have to say his
    target audience is people looking for websites to be built for their companies. He has some cool
    features on here as well. If you hover over his logo, it spins. Also, the navigation bar content rises
    when you hover over it. This is an overall fun and professional header.</p>

    <a href="https://4rsmokehouse.com/">hhttps://4rsmokehouse.com//</a><br>

    <p>4rsmokehouse.com has a great call to action. As you can see the video in the background is constantly moving,
    and showing pictures of there product. Which in this case is the mouth watering food. In the center of the video
    you can see the call to action, that screams at you "look at our menu".</p>

    <p>Team coco is a great website. One great feature is there social media section. This a great way to get there name
    out there to anyone. The social media section will link you to there facebook page, twitter page, and many other
        social pages.

    <a href="https://www.myspace.com">https://www.myspace.com</a><br>

    <p>Myspace.com has always had  a great way to find out about people by viewing there profile page. Each user was able
        to express themselves on there profile page.This could be done by adding a picture, background image, and short
        summery of who they are.

    <a href="http://majorwo0dy.postagon.com/post/new">https://www.postagon.com/</a><br>

    <p>Postagon seemed like a good place to blog. They put everything you need in there post page. You can add images
    and edit your text as well. Blogging isn't something I do but this looks like a easy site to do it on.</p>

    <a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/contact">http://builtbybuffalo.com/contact</a><br>

    <p>This is a nice contacts page. There was a lot of effort put into it. Usually, I just see text that says
        "email" that you click on to send an email. This page added phone numbers, Twitter, Skype. They even have
        icons for each one. Target audience for this webpage are for people that are looking for a website to be built.
        I like the colors on this website because it is simple and clear to see what you are looking for.</p><br><br>

    <a href="http://zzz.drinkzzz.com/">http://zzz.drinkzzz.com/</a><br>

    <p>This one is cool looking, I like the little shirt they have on the page. This makes it fun, and pop out.
        This would be something I would actually enjoy filling out. Target audience? I couldn’t tell you. I have
        no idea what they are selling. If I had to guess, I would say ZZZ is a drink. That could be something they
        need to work on. Maybe they could add more text telling us what they are selling.</p>

    <p>Great Footer! It’s rare to see a footer that uses icons like this. Usually, it's just text in a column.
        Target audience is people that like to use apps on Apple products. These guys build apps for Apple. I
        like the colors on this webpage, they really stand out and make you feel excited.</p>

    <a href="http://www.danielkennedy.com/">http://www.danielkennedy.com//</a><br>

    <p>This photo gallery is nice. I love the spacing between each picture. The colors used on this website give
        it a modern feel. The target audience is people that like fashion, or enjoy beauty. I don't see anything
        on this website that is selling anything, just showing the new trends that are out there.</p>

    <p>Royal-Slider has a good video gallery. When you click on the name
        of the video on the column on the right, the video will slide and display on the left.
        When you want to view the video just click on the video image, and it will play</p>

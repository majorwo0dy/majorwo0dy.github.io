<h1>Inspiration designs</h1>

<h2>Header</h2>

    <a href="http://danielfiller.com/">http://danielfiller.com/</a><br>

<p>The Header that caught my eye was at danielfiller.com. It looks great and so simple to use.
    The designer built this website to show his skills in web development. I would have to say his
    target audience is people looking for websites to be built for their companies. He has some cool
    features on here as well. If you hover over his logo, it spins. Also, the navigation bar content rises
    when you hover over it. This is an overall fun and professional header.</p><br><br>


    <h2>CTA</h2>

    <a href="http://www.man­pack.com/?gclid=CjwKEAjw96aqBRDNh M6MtJfE­wYSJADiMfggWPgIHDDEfjhYZJs_TylDjy4PPEtj
     1jNT3EA1PKCUIhoC6xzw_wcB">http://manpack.com/</a><br>

    <p>Call to Action is fun. Every second there is a new pack design showing and its target audience is clearly men.
        This website makes you want to push that call to action button, and grunt really loud. They did a great job on
        this CTA the colors are dark and the text is bright and calls to you. Again, this site makes it very clear
        "Made for Men”.</p><br><br>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <img src="images/Features.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.pixfx.at/#Home">http://www.pixfx.com</a><br>

    <p>Oh man, this site is awesome; I was in shock when I first opened it. Talk about talented web designers.
        Some of the cool features on this site are the videos that play when you start, that scream, “this is pixfx,
        Welcome”. When you click on a page you want to visit, a female robot voice calls out that page. Also, there
        is some music that plays in the background that pumps you up. The target audience for this website would be
        anyone that is looking for developers of many sorts. They offer development for games, webpages, videos.
        You name it, they offer it.</p><br><br>


    <h2>About</h2>

    <img src="images/About.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.teamsnap.com/about">https://www.teamsnap.com/about</a><br>

    <p>
        This About page is nice to look at and easy to use. There are sub­categories that you can click on and it
        will display on the website. The target audience for this website would be people who have teams and need
        to make rosters and keep track of everyone. This website makes it easier for them to share this information
        with people on the team, or other coaches. I like the colors on this page because they are bright and
        stand out.</p><br><br>



    <h2>Blog</h2>

    <img src="images/blogging.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a><br>

    <p>Blogging: there's no better place to do it than Facebook. It's fun to blog on Facebook, and easy.
        All you have to do is click on the entry field and type. When you’re done, you press the post button.
        Target audience: anyone that likes to talk to their friends, which is everyone. Great site; the colors
        could use some updates but other than that, it gets the job done.</p><br><br>



    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <img src="images/contact.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/contact">http://builtbybuffalo.com/contact</a><br>

    <p>This is a nice contacts page. There was a lot of effort put into it. Usually, I just see text that says
        "email" that you click on to send an email. This page added phone numbers, Twitter, Skype. They even have
        icons for each one. Target audience for this webpage are for people that are looking for a website to be built.
        I like the colors on this website because it is simple and clear to see what you are looking for.</p><br><br>


    <h2>Login/Registration</h2>

    <img src="images/Login:Registration.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="http://zzz.drinkzzz.com/">http://zzz.drinkzzz.com/</a><br>

    <p>This one is cool looking, I like the little shirt they have on the page. This makes it fun, and pop out.
        This would be something I would actually enjoy filling out. Target audience? I couldn’t tell you. I have
        no idea what they are selling. If I had to guess, I would say ZZZ is a drink. That could be something they
        need to work on. Maybe they could add more text telling us what they are selling.</p><br><br>


    <h2>Footer</h2>

    <img src="images/footer.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="http://tapbots.com/">http://tapbots.com/</a><br>

    <p>Great Footer! It’s rare to see a footer that uses icons like this. Usually, it's just text in a column.
        Target audience is people that like to use apps on Apple products. These guys build apps for Apple. I
        like the colors on this webpage, they really stand out and make you feel excited.</p><br><br>




    <h2>Photo Gallery</h2>

    <img src="images/photogallery.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.danielkennedy.com/">http://www.danielkennedy.com//</a><br>

    <p>This photo gallery is nice. I love the spacing between each picture. The colors used on this website give
        it a modern feel. The target audience is people that like fashion, or enjoy beauty. I don't see anything
        on this website that is selling anything, just showing the new trends that are out there.</p><br><br>


    <h2>Home page/video</h2>

    <img src="images/homepage%20.png"max width="100%" height="200px">
    <br>
    <a href="https://4rsmokehouse.com/">https://4rsmokehouse.com/</a><br>

    <p>Home pages to are very important in web design. I definitely want my homepage to move like this when I make
        one. Adding the text in the middle with a button focuses your attention on clicking it, while, at the same
        time, you’re still in awe over the background moving. Target audience would be people that love to eat meat.
        Just looking at this homepage is making me hungry.</p><br><br>
